         <h2>The Blind Leading the Blind</h2>
         <p>Here,
            <em>organisations</em>
            are interdependent human-centred systems like companies, NGOs, adminstrations, clubs, etc. whose main purpose is not the development of software but who want
                                    to
            <em>automate a significant portion of their daily activities with software</em>.</p>
         <div class="with-graphic-sidebar">
            <div>
               <p>Too often, software projects for these organisations:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>fail to achieve essential goals;</li>
                  <li>are greatly delayed or even canceled;</li>
                  <li>exceed budgets by factors of 2, 3 or even 10.</li>
               </ul>
               <p class="air">Most organisations are
                  <em>highly dependent</em>
                  on their IT-solution partners, or worse: on individual developers.</p>
               <p class="air">
                  However, the root cause of this malaise is not any particular IT-solution partner or developer &mdash; it is the
                  <em>inherent immaturity of three essential factors</em>:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>the software industry catering to these organisations;</li>
                  <li>the organisations themselves;</li>
                  <li>the collaboration between IT-solution partner and organisation.</li>

                  <li>organisations have not yet learnt to see and
                     <em>describe their subject matters and processes in a form that is both detailed and conclusive</em>;</li>
                  <li>IT-solution providers keep taking the

               </ul>
               <p class="air">As a consequence, the organisation and the IT-solution provider settle on a raw, peacemeal negotiation and implementation of individual system features
                  <em>without first creating a sound big picture</em>
                  at the process level (see below).</p>

         <h2>Building a Home like Software</h2>
         <p>Today, when a family wants to build a house to live in, there is an almost universal process with the following characteristics:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>an
               <em>architect</em>
               acts as the
               <em>professional, trained intermediary</em>
               between the family and the craftsmen;</li>
            <li>a trained draftsman drafts a number of carefully-aligned,
               <em>precise and detailed blueprints</em>;</li>
            <li>the blueprints are the
               <em>source of truth</em>
               for
               <em>feasibility</em>
               assessments,
               <em>costs</em>
               calculations, and 95% of the
               <em>craftmen's work</em>.</li>
         </ul>
         <p class="air">The following
            <em>domain storytelling</em>
            diagram
            <a href="/pages/references/index.html#1">[2]</a>
            (short
            <em>domain story</em>) illustrates the process. Read the words along each arrow in the order of the numbers, e.g. «Familiy finds architect through a friend»:</p>
         <div class="graphic-full-width">
            <img src="assets/house-domain-story-1.svg" alt="domain story for building a house the traditional way">
         </div>
         <p>The next domain-story diagram is an oversimplified analogy to a typical digital transformation of an organisation. However, it reflects quite well the basic methodology applied to
            digital-transformation scenarios:</p>
         <div class="graphic-full-width">
            <img src="assets/house-domain-story-2.svg" alt="domain story for building a house like software" width="80%">
         </div>
         <p class="air">Here, the characteristics ar:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>there is no professional
               <em>no intermediary</em>: the family interacts directly with the craftsmen (and vice versa);</li>
            <li>there are
               <em>no up-front blueprints</em>
               i.e.
               <em>no «big picture»</em>;</li>
            <li>one element of the house is described, negotiated and built at a time, then the result is evaluated.</li>
            <li>eventually, the house is finished
               <em>without there ever being a picture of the house before</em>.</li>
         </ul>
