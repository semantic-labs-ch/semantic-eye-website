      <h2>The Semantic Eye ...</h2>
      <ul>
         <li>... is a novel, radical, language-based approach to designing, implementing and automating processes.</li>
         <li>... challenges the prevalent, amateurish definition and implemention of software-centred solutions which asumes ...
            <ul>
               <li>that all businesses and subject areas are chaotic,</li>
               <li>and that therefore any up-front planning is doomed and must be avoided.</li>
            </ul>
         </li>
         <li>... focuses on processes of organisations where humans and machines collaborate to achieve goals repeatably.</li>
         <li>... looks at organisations, subject areas and process with a «fresh pair of eyes», i.e. with the inqusitive mindset of ...
            <ul>
               <li>understanding the true meaning (semantics) of and motivation (why?) behind concepts and activities;</li>
               <li>reducing complexity by separating real business needs and concepts from technical solutions and implementation details;</li>
               <li>challenging the status quo with simpler solutions and the use of current technologies.</li>
            </ul>
         </li>
         <li>... uses a ubiquitous, shared process language that ...</li>
         <ul>
            <li>can be read and understood by all shareholders;</li>
            <li>enables shareholders to capture and share requirements, ideas and solutions;</li>
            <li>makes communication much more effective and efficient.</li>
         </ul>
         <li>... detects and highlights misconceptions, misunderstandings and avoidable errors early;</li>
         <li>... creates shared models of current and future solutions that can be studied and challenged by all stakeholders;</li>
         <li>... insists on an aligned and accepted «big picture» of the future solution before implementation begins.</li>
      </ul>

            <li>offers synchronised graphical and textual views to suit the needs of different stakeholders;</li>

         <h2>The Blind Leading the Blind</h2>
         <p>Here,
            <em>organisations</em>
            are interdependent human-centred systems like companies, NGOs, adminstrations, clubs, etc. whose main purpose is not the development of software but who want to
            <em>automate a significant portion of their daily activities with software</em>.</p>
         <div class="with-graphic-sidebar">
            <div>
               <p>Too often, software projects for these organisations:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>fail to achieve essential goals;</li>
                  <li>are greatly delayed or even canceled;</li>

               </ul>
               <p class="air">Most organisations are
                  <em>highly dependent</em>
                  on their IT-solution partners, or worse: on individual developers.</p>
               <p class="air">
                  However, the root cause of this malaise is not any particular IT-solution partner or developer &mdash; it is the
                  <em>inherent immaturity of three essential factors</em>:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>the software industry catering to these organisations;</li>
                  <li>the organisations themselves;</li>

         <h2>Building a Home like Software</h2>
         <p>Today, when a family wants to build a home to live in, there is an almost universal process with the following characteristics:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>an
               <em>architect</em>
               acts as the
               <em>professional intermediary</em>
               between the family and the craftsmen;</li>
            <li>a
               <em>trained draftsman</em>
               creates a number of aligned,
               <em>precise and detailed blueprints</em>;</li>
            <li>the blueprints
               <ul>
                  <li>are
                     <em>a visual model</em>
                     of the house to be built;</li>
                  <li>use a highly standardised
                     <em>visual language</em>
                     to avoid ambiguities among the parties and thus mistakes and cost;</li>
                  <li>
                     <em>are the source of truth</em>
                     for
                     <em>feasibility</em>
                     assessments,
                     <em>costs</em>
                     calculations, and for 95% of the
                     <em>craftmen's work</em>.</li>
               </ul>
            </li>
            <li>the use of
               <em>digital CAD tools</em>
               increases the productivity and quality of drafting;</li>
         </ul>
         <p class="air">The following
            <em>Domain Storytelling</em>
            diagram
            <a href="/pages/references/index.html#2">[2]</a>
            (short
            <em>domain story</em>) illustrates the process. Read the words along each sequence of arrows in the order of the numbers, e.g. «(1) Familiy finds architect through a friend»:</p>
         <div class="graphic-full-width">
            <img src="assets/house-domain-story-1.svg" alt="domain story for building a house the traditional way">
         </div>
         <p>The next domain-story diagram is an oversimplified analogy to a typical digital transformation of an organisation. However, it reflects quite well the basic methodology applied to
            digital-transformation scenarios:</p>
         <div class="graphic-full-width">
            <img src="assets/house-domain-story-2.svg" alt="domain story for building a house like software" width="80%">
         </div>
         <p class="air">Here, the characteristics are:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>there is
               <em>no professional intermediary</em>
               &mdash; the family interacts directly with the craftsmen (and vice versa);</li>
            <li>there are
               <em>no up-front blueprints</em>
               i.e.
               <em>no «big picture»</em>;</li>
            <li>each element of the house is negotiated, built and assessed individually &mdash; this is
               <em>inefficient</em>;</li>
            <li>
               <em>no truly digital tools</em>are used to boost productivit and quality (except for the actual software development);
            </li>
            <li>eventually, the house is finished
               <em>without there ever being a picture of the house before</em>.</li>
         </ul>
         <p class="air standout">In summary:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>at no point is there a coherent description of the house that is accessible to all parties, and on which the parties can aligin and agree;</li>
            <li>misunderstandings and mistakes are inevitable;</li>
            <li>if the house is to be extended or remodeled in the future, the parties will have to tackle each new need or design indivually and on the object itself;</li>
            <li>anything invisible to the naked eye (water pipes, electrical cables, insulation, strength of beams and ceilings, etc.) is a risk to future changes.
         </ul>
         <p class="air standout">Did You Know?</p>
         <p class="air">
            <em>Blueprints were introduced to building construction in the 15th century</em>
            because both quality and productivity were considered insufficient
            <a href="/pages/references/index.html#3">[3]</a>. Before that, the architect and the craftsmen huddled every morning and discussed the works of the day. Sounds familiar? Today, developer teams do it
               again and call it «daily standup» or «daily scrum».</p>
